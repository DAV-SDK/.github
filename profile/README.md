## DAV-SDK

The data, analysis, and visualization (DAV) software development kit (SDK), or DAV-SDK, is an integration effort for the collection of data I/O & compression, analysis, and visualization software developed under the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR). The software products target using Spack, an HPC-targeted source-based package manager, for deployment on HPC platforms and beyond. The primary product of this project is the davsdk Spack meta-package which builds a set of DAV-SDK member packages together in a way that enables optimal features for target environments as well as interoperable features provided by other packages within the DAV-SDK. The DAV-SDK is an outcome of the work within the DOE PESO and OASIS projects.
